With over a quarters worth of time to debate, design and develop, Brahma Badges are finally set to arrive and are here to stay! Here‚Äôs exactly why it matters and all that you need to do to unlock our version of Brahma‚Äôs achievment to-kwans.

Long story short, our community degens have upheld and spread the word of Brahma diligently in exchange for onchain + offchain calculations that sum up to deliver a consistently fluctuating karma score.

And while the thrill of demystifying karma‚Äôs ‚Äúpamps and dumps‚Äù keeps the community speculating, it was finally time to gib the users almost an equal if not more concrete symbolism of their compounding efforts.

One that would not be Brahma‚Äôs most solemn mystery to decipher.

Long-term Compoundings
Arriving as part of season 1‚Äôs drop, are 11 Brahma badges that are carefully curated with some badges prospectively compounding from the onset of release, an opportunity to rewrite your efforts. As the community makes its way to the citadel, Brahma would like you to envision and strive for greater holdings of karma points and badges, if you wish to unlock Brahma‚Äôs highest, most generous ‚Äúfuture offerings‚Äù.

And that‚Äôs the legend that has been projected during the composition of this post.

What to pin?üëÄ
Brahma Badges are currently diversified in 3 actionable parts, Community-based, Contributor-based and Depositooor-based badges. Each badge holding multiple rings a.k.a levels is set to demostrate how your community efforts compound to unlock badges of increasing rarity until you finally reach grind salvation. Each badge has a differential updating timeline, ranging from immediate to monthly and quaterly unlocks.

Each badge would indicate a roadmap to conquer the achievement minus the deprivation of information. Clear, crisp and compounding actions that would lead you to seize your pin.

Why do Brahma Badges have different rarity levels?
Right, Let‚Äôs first talk rarity. While all badges start off as uncommon badges, there would be some achievements that instantly unlock higher rarity based on the communities retrospective level of action.

Brahma badges, currently and moving forward will broadly belong to the following categories:

1Ô∏è‚É£Uncommon: Repetitive, simple actions that compound overtime.

2Ô∏è‚É£Common: Repetitive, effort-intensive actions that signal community loyalty (can be monetory as well as non-monetory)

3Ô∏è‚É£Rare: One-time efforts requiring substantial contributions (can be monetory as well as non-monetory)

4Ô∏è‚É£Super Rare: Time-locked, one-time opportunities that rarely repeat; demonstrating massive protocol sumport (can be monetory as well as non-monetory)

5Ô∏è‚É£Maxi: Apex-level ground-breaking achievements compounded overtime; consistency fuelled actions (can be monetory as well as non monetory)

Upcoming Levels, Tiers and Transferrability
With v1.1 update, some Brahma badges may fade retrospective winooors to restart a fresh cycle of achievers, making the badges transferrable in nature. This would particularly be applicable for all contribution related badges.

As for badges that involve, community and deposit actions, levels demonstrating points accumulated/unique vaults participation would be introduced to make badge awarding more transparent and systematic. Levels are set to be demostrated by individual glowing rings that light up or down based on updgrade/downgrade.

Each level fulfilled by a user would lead to ‚ÄúTier‚Äù unlocks resulting in upgraded rarity that boost your badges. PS: We are taking your custom proposed badge suggestions for the S2 drop here, fyi.

In other news, plans to enable badge flex access on both twitter as well as discord are on the cards.
